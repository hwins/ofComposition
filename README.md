ofComposition
=============

This is an OpenFrameworks C++ based abstact visual and audio algorithmic composition.

It is set up for Eclipse CDT. Compile against the OpenFrameworks libs after pulling them from their home in github to local user git directory. See Makefile. Note: in addition to OpenFramework libraries this requires boost shared_ptr.hpp.

The algorithm will randomly compose visual and sound interactions with mouse movement. The mouse movements are in lieu of a motion sensor device, however use of a motion sensor is better.
